# RL-Progress
This is a personal repository of my progress in Reinforcement Learning. Developing different environments and agents and understanding how they work based on the Deep Reinforcement Learning book.

Resources used early:
- Core theory of reinforcement learning:

https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/9811382840

These core text book are the key to my early progress in understanding core Reinforcement Learning strategies and mathematical equations such as value and policy iteration which are inspired by Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and use Dynamic Programming (DP), to solve the optimisation and finding the policy problem. The main takeaway appears to be that solving MDP using DP, is computationally expensive and challenging to implement in practical applications. They are restrained by limited discrete actions and the exploration of all possible actions in all possible states. A rather impractical way to deal with more complex problems. Nonetheless, as both resources have detailed, these are core concepts in RL.

Indeed, the Python code for value iteration reflects our fear of a computationally expensive code for more complex problems.
